## 2017-03-20 - Release 1.1.0

### Summary

This release adds a new `summary` tag which can be used to add a short description to classes, functions, types, and providers. In addition, `@param` tags can now include type information in Puppet 4 code without warnings being issued.

All related tickets can be found under the [PDOC](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDOC) JIRA project with the fix version of [1.1.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?filter=25603).

### Features
- The `summary` tag can be added to any code that puppet-strings supports. The recommended length limit for a summary is 140 characters. Warnings will be issued for strings longer than this limit.
- Puppet 4 parameter types can now be explicitly documented. Previously, this was not allowed because Puppet 4 parameter types can be automatically determined without extra documentation. However, users may desire to do so anyway for consistency. Strings will emit a warning if the documented type does not match the actual type. In such an event, the incorrect documented type will be ignored in favor of the real one.

## 2016-11-28 - Release 1.0.0

### Summary

This release fixes up minor bugs from the 0.99.0 release and modifies the JSON schema for Puppet functions.

All related tickets can be found under the [PDOC](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDOC) JIRA project with the fix version of [1.0.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?filter=23607).

### Features
- The JSON schema for Puppet functions has been altered to include a new 'signatures' top-level key **(PDOC-125)**
  - Includes information about all function signatures (overloads). Existing overload key format has been preserved.
- Reworked README for enhanced clarity **(PDOC-133)**

### BugFixes
- Fixed an issue where the search box in the code navigator overlapped list items below it **(PDOC-93)**
- Strings can now handle multiple `defaultfor` calls in Puppet providers **(PDOC-95)**
- Fixed an issue preventing the generated \_index.html file from being uploaded to GitHub pages via the gh_pages task **(PDOC-120)**
- Fixed several issues with String's handling of Puppet 3.x and 4.x function return types **(PDOC-135)**, **(PDOC-136)**
- Fixed an issue where String's didn't properly parse overloads if no summary description was provided **(PDOC-129)**
- Strings now correctly handles Puppet 3.x functions when the `newfunction` call is on a newline **(PDOC-122)**
- Fixed an issue where certain Ruby string constructs were incompletely stripped from some docstrings **(PDOC-126)**
- Hanging indents from type feature descriptions are now properly stripped **(PDOC-127)**

## 2016-10-10 - Release 0.99.0

### Summary

This release includes a complete rewrite of strings, fixing many bugs from previous versions and generally improving the user experience. This release is intended to be the last stop before the strings major version 1.0 is released, and nearly all of the functionality of the major release is included.

All related tickets can be found under the [PDOC][PDOC JIRA] JIRA project with the fix version of [0.99.0](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/issues/?filter=22705).

### Features
- Complete overhaul, including code cleanup, bug fixes and new functionality **(PDOC-63)**
  - Documentation has been split into sections based on type: puppet 3x API functions, puppet 4x API functions, ruby classes, puppet language functions, types, and providers
  - New JSON schema organized to reflect the separation of types
  - Support for custom functions written in the puppet language
  - Support for puppet function overloads via the create_function 4.x API
  - YARD bumped to latest version, 0.9.5
- Markdown is now the default format for parsing docstring text **(PDOC-86)**
  - Note: this means Markdown text in YARD comments and tags, not a change in the output of strings
- New commandline options: --emit-json and --emit-json-stdout to generate JSON documentation **(PDOC-84)**
- Runtime dependency on Puppet has been removed, allowing strings to function in Puppet Enterprise 3.8 **(PDOC-80)**
  - Note that the gem still requires puppet. We recommend that the strings gem be installed with puppet, as suggested in the  [README](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings/blob/master/README.md#installing-puppet-strings)
- New gemspec requirement on Ruby version 1.9.3, the oldest supported Ruby version

### BugFixes

- Prevents a blizzard of errors when documenting Puppet Core source and some puppet modules **(PDOC-63)**
  - As this is a complete rewrite, many known and unknown bugs from the original code were fixed along the way
- Allow strings to be installed in PE 3.8 without overwriting existing puppet and facter installations with newer gems
